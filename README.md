This Jupyter Notebook uses the Python module Lightkurve to extract data from an opensource databank containing lightcurves for targets of the Kepler and K2 mission.
Lightkurve is also able to access data from the more recent TESS mission, so the notebook can easily be adjusted to access either.
These missions use the transit method to identify exoplanet candidates around host starts. By identifying periodic dips in the flux of a star, the presence of an exoplanet can be inferred assuming the magnitude of the dip in flux is in proportion to what would be expected for a planet passing in front of a star.
